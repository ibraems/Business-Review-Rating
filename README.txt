Business Review Rating
- **`data.csv`** contains the dataset. 
- Each observation (row) in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.
- The **stars** column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.
- The **text** column is the text of the review.

**Goal:** Predict the star rating of a review using **only** the review text.
